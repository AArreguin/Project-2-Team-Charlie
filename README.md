## Problem 
–  Have you always had a problem trying to find the right diet plan for you?  The certain foods you eat can have big effects on your health and quality of life.  Although eating healthy can be fairly simple, the rise in popular “diets” and dieting trends has caused confusion.  In fact, these trends often distract from the basic nutrition principles that are most important.

## Solution 
– This application will be a detailed guide to healthy eating, based on nutritional science. It can develop healthy eating habits for the user by helping them share certain dishes/meals with thier friends and family.  It will also help the user find where they can find these meals/dishes at certain restaurants as well

!

- We will be using two APIs for our project: 
- 1. To obtain recipes and their nutrition: https://developer.edamam.com/
- 2. Find/search restaurants: https://documenu.com/docs#get_menu_items_for_restaurant

## Appetite 
– We want to be able to fit this project within a timeframe of 6 weeks

## Rabbit Holes 
- User interface will be too complex if the user tries to add a food item that is not included within the APIs.
- User may have a difficult time trying to save their modified meals/recipes/ingredients

## No Goes
* Due to time constrains we would be only providing service in the local city, in our case it's Chicago.
* Service will only serve users with an account and no guest users.
* Our team is not thinking about making a email notification system for the service. 
* Service will not include routs and directions for the serving restaurants.
* Service will be advising but not professionaly recommending nutritions/diets due to legal restrictions.
* Service will not have an integrated map feature.
* Service will not promote or advertise buisnesses or will be used as a advertisement platform.
