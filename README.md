## Problem 
– Have you had problems trying to find better eating habits that is more suited for you?  Have you ever wished that there was a way to just look at certain dieting plans with the convenience of your phone/web browser?  There are certain foods that we eat that cause negative effects on our health and quality in life.  Although eating healthy can be fairly simple, the rise in popular “diets” and dieting trends has caused a lot of confusion.  In fact, these trends often distract from the basic nutrition principles that are most important for all of our personal needs.  

## Solution 
– Some users may use our site, not even knowing what they are looking for in the first place.  With our assistance, we can suggest and provide guides, articles, and plans to better eating that suit you. We will implement a user-friendly interface that will display these guides and suggestions with touchscreen technology and swiping through them with ease.  We plan to do this by making our main page displayed with photos of certain foods that catch your interest, which then assists the user where the want to browse right from the get go.

## Appetite 
– We want to be able to fit this project within a timeframe of 6 weeks

## Rabbit Holes 
- Our site may be too complex if we don't supply a user-friendly interface that can start them off with either suggestions or guides to better dieting
- If we don't assist the user with navigating our main page, then they may have a difficult time finding exactly what it is they are looking for
